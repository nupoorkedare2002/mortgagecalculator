## Setup

Inorder to setup the project we need to install react, material-ui & other necessary packages. First create a folder named `mortgage-calculator` and then run the following command in the terminal

```bash
npx create-react-app .
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install --save chart.js react-chartjs-2
```

## MUI Theme

We will be using the dark theme of material UI. For that we need to create a file named `theme.js` in the `src` folder and add the following code



**Note:** If you don't pass the `CssBaseline` component we will not be able to see the MUI dark theme.
